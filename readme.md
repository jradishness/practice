# My Practice

This is a repository of programs that I have created, typically for practice to hone my skills.

`language_detector_k.py` is a character bigram or trigram language model to predict the language of a text

`naivebayes.ipynb` is a "from scratch" implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm in the context of spam classification

`postagger_dev.py` is a Hidden Markov Model Viterbi algorithm for Part-of-Speech tagging.
