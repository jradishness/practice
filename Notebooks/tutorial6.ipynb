      "Church were deeds, not words. The context supplies a number of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such as the following are specified in it: their work; their toil, which\n",
      "\n",

      "of the great act on which it is based, and the specification of the\n",

      "\n",
      "writes, the Apostle is realising the mediation of Christ, and that the\n",

      "order of mention is the order of our approach. The Father comes to us in\n",

      "magnificent and beneficent divine deeds, so correspondent to His love,\n",
      "\n",
      "and so inclusive of all His giving, as that it shall be the ground of\n",
      "\n",
      "our confidence and the warrant for our prayers. The gift of Jesus Christ\n",
      "\n",
      "is that in which everlasting consolation and good hope are bestowed upon\n",
